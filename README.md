# Steganography_hidding_image_in_aonther
Steganography is the hiding of a secret message within an ordinary message and the extraction of it at its destination. In this program we are going to hide (encode) a secret valuable image inside another image via using pixel value manipulations. And later retrieving the secret image back at the receiver end using the corresponding program as well.
